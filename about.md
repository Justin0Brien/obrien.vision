## About — Justin O’Brien, PhD  
**Psychologist, vision scientist & AI consultant**

I’m a cognitive scientist with 20+ years in academic research on visual perception and social cognition, formerly a Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Brunel University London. My research spanned face and expression recognition, ageing and emotion, and visual processing differences in conditions such as autism, using behavioural experiments, neuroimaging (fMRI/EEG) and computational tools like representational similarity analysis (RSA).

### What I do now
At **OBrien.vision**, I translate rigorous behavioural science into **human-centred AI** practice. I design evaluation protocols for computer-vision and multimodal models, audit model behaviour against human performance, and help teams implement interpretable, responsible workflows—so leaders can make clear product and policy decisions with evidence they trust.

**Typical engagements**
- **Model evaluations** that combine user studies, psychophysics-style tasks and statistical/RSA analyses to probe what models “pay attention” to.  
- **Human-in-the-loop testing** to uncover failure modes (bias, brittleness, ambiguity) before they reach production.  
- **Decision support**: translating findings into roadmaps, guardrails and clear communication for executives and regulators.

### Track record (selected)
- **Autism & facial motion**: Evidence that adults with autism show specific difficulties using **dynamic facial motion** for identity and emotion—helping to separate attentional accounts from perceptual mechanisms.  [5 PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0102173&utm_source=chatgpt.com) [6 ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141113075051.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Ageing & emotion**: Work linking **changes in functional connectivity** to differences in recognising negative facial expressions across adulthood.  [7 PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34666297/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [8 bura.brunel.ac.uk](https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/23899/1/Preprint.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Concepts vs cues**: Studies disentangling **stimulus-based cues** (shape/texture) from **high-level emotion concepts** in how people judge facial expressions—an approach that maps neatly to explainability questions in AI.

### How we can work together
- **AI readiness & risk reviews** for computer-vision / multimodal products.  
- **Evaluation design**: gold-standard testbeds that reflect real-world ambiguity, not just leaderboard metrics.  
- **Workshops & leadership briefings**: clear, evidence-based guidance on human-centred AI and model interpretability.  
- **Collaboration with product/data teams** to embed measurement, documentation and iteration into the delivery cadence.

If you’d like, I can tailor a one-page service sheet and a speaking bio to match this site’s tone—plus SEO-ready copy for pages targeting **“human-centred AI evaluation”** and **“computer-vision auditing”**.
