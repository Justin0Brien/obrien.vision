    What do you call this? 🤔 Apart from ‘dog’ 🐶 or 'golden retriever' 🦮

    Ambiguous figure 🌀
    Reversible figure 🔄
    Bistable image ↔️
    Multistable image 🔁
    180-degree rotationally reversible figure 🔄🔢
    Rotationally ambiguous drawing 🔄✏️
    Upside-down illusion 🙃
    Topsy-turvey picture 🤹‍♂️🖼️

    “Ambigram” sounds good but it’s only for words. 🔤✍️
    “Ambigraph”? 🤔🖋️
    “Ambipic”? 🤔🖼️

    It's two dogs, btw. Inverted is a sort of shih-tzu

    And my vote goes to Ambipic

The original resolution is really low (256x256)
These images aren't the result of clever prompting, but of generating hundreds of images and then combing through them for the few that are decent.
