    Dog person or cat person? With this picture you can be both.

    This single image is both doe-eyed puppy and sour-faced cat, depending on which way is up. A neat reminder that in Vision Science—and in Generative AI—perspective really is everything.

The original resolution is really low (256x256)
These images aren't the result of clever prompting, but of generating hundreds of images and then combing through them for the few that are decent.
