    <h1 id="visualizing-career-transitions-the-story-behind-the-sankey-diagram">Visualizing Career Transitions: The Story Behind the Sankey Diagram</h1>

<p>When I set out to visualize employment outcomes for professionals aged 50+ following redundancy, I knew the story was complex. Unlike a simple before-and-after comparison, career transitions unfold over time, with multiple pathways and outcomes that shift as months pass.</p>

<p>The <a href="/sankey.html">interactive Sankey diagram</a> I created tells this story through the flow of percentages across different time periods, revealing patterns that might be lost in traditional charts or tables.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-sankey-diagram">Why a Sankey Diagram?</h2>

<p>Sankey diagrams excel at showing flow and transition. They’re perfect for visualizing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proportional relationships</strong>: The width of each flow represents the percentage of people following that path</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple outcomes</strong>: Unlike pie charts that show a single moment, Sankey diagrams can show how outcomes evolve</li>
  <li><strong>Complex pathways</strong>: Some people find professional jobs quickly, others cycle through different states before settling into long-term outcomes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-data-story">The Data Story</h2>

<p>The visualization reveals several key insights:</p>

<h3 id="early-struggles">Early Struggles</h3>

<p>At 3 months post-redundancy, 65% of professionals aged 50+ remain unemployed. This stark figure highlights the immediate challenge this demographic faces in the job market.</p>

<h3 id="gradual-recovery">Gradual Recovery</h3>

<p>By 6 months, the unemployment rate drops to 38%, and by 12 months to 30%. However, this recovery isn’t just about finding similar professional roles – it’s about adaptation and compromise.</p>

<h3 id="the-new-normal">The New Normal</h3>

<p>After 24 months, the data shows a “new normal” where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>45% eventually return to professional roles</li>
  <li>10% accept lower-paid positions</li>
  <li>15% become self-employed</li>
  <li>30% remain unemployed long-term</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design-decisions">Design Decisions</h2>

<p>Several design choices enhance the storytelling:</p>

<h3 id="color-coding">Color Coding</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blue</strong>: Professional employment (positive outcome)</li>
  <li><strong>Orange</strong>: Lower-paid employment (compromise outcome)</li>
  <li><strong>Green</strong>: Self-employment (alternative pathway)</li>
  <li><strong>Red</strong>: Unemployment (challenge outcome)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gradients">Gradients</h3>

<p>Links between nodes use gradients that blend the source and target colors, visually representing the transition between different employment states.</p>

<h3 id="time-labels">Time Labels</h3>

<p>Clear time markers help users understand the progression and see how outcomes evolve over the critical first two years.</p>

<h3 id="responsive-design">Responsive Design</h3>

<p>The diagram adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining readability and impact.</p>

<h2 id="technical-implementation">Technical Implementation</h2>

<p>Built with D3.js and the d3-sankey plugin, the visualization processes flow data to create smooth, proportional connections between employment states across time periods.</p>

<p>Key technical features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Responsive SVG rendering</li>
  <li>Interactive tooltips showing exact percentages</li>
  <li>Hover effects to highlight specific flows</li>
  <li>Gradient definitions for smooth color transitions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-broader-context">The Broader Context</h2>

<p>This visualization is part of a larger investigation into age-related employment challenges. The data combines insights from multiple sources including ONS statistics, Labour Force Survey data, and research from organizations like Ageing Better and the Resolution Foundation.</p>

<p>The goal isn’t just to present statistics, but to make the human impact of redundancy visible and understandable to policymakers, employers, and the affected individuals themselves.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>This Sankey diagram opens up several avenues for further exploration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regional variations in outcomes</li>
  <li>Industry-specific transition patterns</li>
  <li>The role of skills in successful transitions</li>
  <li>Interventions that improve outcomes</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m continuing to develop interactive tools that make employment data more accessible and actionable. Each visualization aims to bridge the gap between raw statistics and human understanding.</p>
