<p>When I set out to visualize employment outcomes for professionals aged 50+ following redundancy, I knew the story was complex. Unlike a simple before-and-after comparison, career transitions unfold over time, with multiple pathways and outcomes that shift as months pass.</p>

<p>The <a href="/sankey.html">interactive Sankey diagram</a> I created tells this story through the flow of percentages across different time periods, revealing patterns that might be lost in traditional charts or tables.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-sankey-diagram">Why a Sankey Diagram?</h2>

<p>Sankey diagrams excel at showing flow and transition. They’re perfect for visualizing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Proportional relationships</strong>: The width of each flow represents the percentage of people following that path</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple outcomes</strong>: Unlike pie charts that show a single moment, Sankey diagrams can show how outcomes evolve</li>
  <li><strong>Complex pathways</strong>: Some people find professional jobs quickly, others cycle through different states before settling into long-term outcomes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-data-story">The Data Story</h2>

<p>The visualization reveals several key insights:</p>

<h3 id="early-struggles">Early Struggles</h3>

<p>At 3 months post-redundancy, 65% of professionals aged 50+ remain unemployed. This stark figure highlights the immediate challenge this demographic faces in the job market.</p>

<h3 id="gradual-recovery">Gradual Recovery</h3>

<p>By 6 months, the unemployment rate drops to 38%, and by 12 months to 30%. However, this recovery isn’t just about finding similar professional roles – it’s about adaptation and compromise.</p>

<h3 id="the-new-normal">The New Normal</h3>

<p>After 24 months, the data shows a “new normal” where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>45% eventually return to professional roles</li>
  <li>10% accept lower-paid positions</li>
  <li>15% become self-employed</li>
  <li>30% remain unemployed long-term</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design-decisions">Design Decisions</h2>

<p>Several design choices enhance the storytelling:</p>

<h3 id="color-coding">Color Coding</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blue</strong>: Professional employment (positive outcome)</li>
  <li><strong>Orange</strong>: Lower-paid employment (compromise outcome)</li>
  <li><strong>Green</strong>: Self-employment (alternative pathway)</li>
  <li><strong>Red</strong>: Unemployment (challenge outcome)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gradients">Gradients</h3>

<p>Links between nodes use gradients that blend the source and target colors, visually representing the transition between different employment states.</p>

<h3 id="time-labels">Time Labels</h3>

<p>Clear time markers help users understand the progression and see how outcomes evolve over the critical first two years.</p>

<h3 id="responsive-design">Responsive Design</h3>

<p>The diagram adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining readability and impact.</p>

<h2 id="technical-implementation">Technical Implementation</h2>

<p>Built with D3.js and the d3-sankey plugin, the visualization processes flow data to create smooth, proportional connections between employment states across time periods.</p>

<p>Key technical features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Responsive SVG rendering</li>
  <li>Interactive tooltips showing exact percentages</li>
  <li>Hover effects to highlight specific flows</li>
  <li>Gradient definitions for smooth color transitions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-broader-context">The Broader Context</h2>

<p>This visualization is part of a larger investigation into age-related employment challenges. The data combines insights from multiple sources including ONS statistics, Labour Force Survey data, and research from organizations like Ageing Better and the Resolution Foundation.</p>

<p>The goal isn’t just to present statistics, but to make the human impact of redundancy visible and understandable to policymakers, employers, and the affected individuals themselves.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>This Sankey diagram opens up several avenues for further exploration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Regional variations in outcomes</li>
  <li>Industry-specific transition patterns</li>
  <li>The role of skills in successful transitions</li>
  <li>Interventions that improve outcomes</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m continuing to develop interactive tools that make employment data more accessible and actionable. Each visualization aims to bridge the gap between raw statistics and human understanding.</p>

<h2 id="four-months-in-mid-life-employment-limbo">Four Months in Mid-Life Employment Limbo</h2>

<p>I was made redundant 4 months ago today.</p>

<p><strong>31 March:</strong> I executed the traditional farewell ritual of the mid-career professional: an almost-imperceptible shrug in the general direction of the photocopier and a short walk to the car park. No speeches, no novelty cake, not even a limp balloon. Just me, a cardboard box and the sort of existential soundtrack you normally get in French cinema.</p>

<p><strong>1 April:</strong> New month, new life. I was up with the larks, pounding the cross-trainer in a heroic attempt to sculpt a “new me”. Resistance machines were conquered, endorphins flowed, and—for a glorious forty-eight hours—I was basically the poster child for Mid-Life Reinvention.</p>

<p><strong>3 April:</strong> Doughnuts happened. Then ice cream. If Ben &amp; Jerry ever need to boost quarterly sales, they should simply make more fifty-somethings redundant; we’ll do the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>Fast-forward four months: zero salary, zero job, and—rather paradoxically—a very busy diary. I’ve uploaded a few LinkedIn posts and articles, but that’s the tip of the iceberg. It turns out that finding work in 2025 is very different from the last time I was in the job market. That was when Mark Zuckerberg was still in high school, Elon Musk had yet to be fired from PayPal, and Google was a long way from becoming a verb.</p>

<p>So what’s it actually like, drifting through middle-age employment limbo with a gym membership you no longer use and a freezer full of salted-caramel regret?</p>

<p><strong>It’s actually not too bad, apart from the whole zero salary thing.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-game">The Numbers Game</h2>

<p>And I’m not alone. Exiting a professional job in your fifties (unwillingly) is not a rare occurrence, especially in 2025.</p>

<p>To figure out what happens next, I turned not to necromancy or tarot cards but to statistics and data visualisation. I’ve done a little research, the sources for which you’ll find at the end of this article. There isn’t a single definitive source of data so I’ve extracted some figures and done some careful extrapolation. And guesswork.</p>

<iframe src="/sankey.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" style="border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;"></iframe>

<h3 id="figure-1-career-pathways-after-redundancy-at-50">Figure 1. Career Pathways After Redundancy at 50+</h3>

<p>Should I be worried that after 4 months I don’t have a job - any job? Not really. Only <strong>14% of my age group have another professional job within 3 months</strong> of leaving the old one. Another 14% are in lower paid work, and 7% say they’re “self-employed”, but <strong>two thirds are still jobless</strong>.</p>

<p>This jobless figure does drop and two years after redundancy only 20% are unemployed, although long term this goes up to nearly a third.</p>

<p>Should I be concerned that the odds are against me: I have a <strong>less than evens chance</strong> of landing in a professional job sometime in the next few years?</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-odds">Understanding the Odds</h2>

<p>Some people resist any discussion of probability, preferring an unexamined optimism that screens out unfavourable statistics. I take the opposite view: the more granular the data—baseline rates, confidence intervals, omitted caveats—the better. Equipped with that information, we can assess alternatives rationally rather than intuitively.</p>

<p>For me, this is what it means to <strong>beat the odds</strong>. It is not a matter of willing a coin to land heads or expecting double-sixes on demand; it is a systematic appraisal of the distribution of outcomes under different courses of action and an informed adjustment of strategy in light of those probabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Chance remains a constant, but its impact can be moderated when we understand, rather than ignore, the numbers.</strong></p>

<p>There’s much more to say about what these figures tell us, but even I know that an article full of numbers should be brief.</p>

<h2 id="a-clear-and-candid-guide-to-ai-ethics">A Clear and Candid Guide to AI Ethics</h2>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has catapulted from the plaything of graduate students to the digital weather system that now soaks every corner of the economy. The upsides are dazzling; the downsides, well, they’re the reason you’re reading this article instead of a holiday brochure.</p>

<p>This paper peers—torch in hand—into the trickier nooks of AI from a global vantage point. We’ll rummage through its resource guzzling, copyright snacking, bias-soaked data diet, the Silicon Valley swagger that births it, and the many honourable (and not-so-honourable) uses already on parade.</p>

<h2 id="energy-and-human-resource-consumption">Energy and Human Resource Consumption</h2>

<h3 id="the-environmental-footprint-of-ai">The Environmental Footprint of AI</h3>

<p>Training large AI models requires enormous computational power, translating into heavy energy usage and a substantial carbon footprint. For example, the training of OpenAI’s GPT-3 model is estimated to have consumed <strong>1,287 MWh of electricity</strong>, emitting over <strong>550 metric tons of CO₂</strong> – on par with hundreds of transatlantic flights<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This process also used more than 700,000 liters of water for cooling data centre servers<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Globally, data centres (which host AI workloads among other tasks) account for about <strong>1.5% of electricity consumption</strong> (around 415 TWh in 2024), a share expected to roughly double by 2030 due to AI growth<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. In practical terms, that means data centres could soon draw nearly 945 TWh annually – about as much power as the entire country of Japan uses in a year<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Major tech hubs like the US, Europe and China currently consume 85% of data centre energy<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, highlighting a global disparity. Even after models are trained, the energy for running AI (“inference”) at scale can eclipse training costs – one study noted that inference could comprise 90% of an AI model’s total energy lifecycle as millions of users prompt these models daily<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="the-human-labour-behind-automated-ai">The Human Labour Behind “Automated” AI</h3>

<p>Less visible but equally critical is the human labour powering AI development. Behind every “smart” AI system are often thousands of human workers who label data, moderate content, and train AI models – tasks that can be repetitive, grueling, or psychologically taxing.</p>

<p>In 2021, OpenAI quietly outsourced the job of filtering toxic and harmful content (to make ChatGPT safer) to contractors in Kenya, <strong>paying them less than $2 per hour</strong>. These workers had to read and label tens of thousands of disturbing text snippets – including descriptions of child sexual abuse, torture, and violence – so that the AI could learn to recognise and avoid producing such content<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The psychological toll was enormous: moderators reported trauma, anxiety and lasting mental health damage from constant exposure to graphic material<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. Several have since filed petitions and lawsuits (for instance, in Kenya) over exploitative conditions – citing low pay (around $1.50–$3 an hour), inadequate counseling support, and even abrupt dismissals after the projects ended<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This “ghost work” underpins not just ChatGPT but many AI services – from social media moderation to self-driving car vision – often outsourced to developing countries where labour is cheap.</p>

<h2 id="copyright-and-creator-rights">Copyright and Creator Rights</h2>

<p>AI’s voracious appetite for data has it nibbling at every creative buffet—books, art, code, music—often without so much as a “may I?”. Contemporary AI models learn from vast datasets scraped from the internet – encompassing books, articles, code, images, music and more – much of which is copyrighted material obtained without explicit consent from the authors or artists.</p>

<h3 id="unconsented-training-data">Unconsented Training Data</h3>

<p>Writers, visual artists, musicians and other creators have grown alarmed at AI models being trained on their work. In mid-2023, a group of prominent authors – including <strong>Michael Chabon, Jodi Picoult and George R.R. Martin</strong> – sued OpenAI, alleging that their novels and essays were used to train ChatGPT without consent<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>.</p>

<p>They pointed out that the chatbot could accurately summarise their books or imitate their writing styles, implying it had effectively ingested and learned from their copyrighted texts<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>. This lawsuit is one of several class actions by authors and publishers against AI firms, and it followed similar cases by visual artists against generative AI image companies<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In a landmark example, a class-action suit <strong>Andersen v. Stability AI</strong> was filed in 2023 by a group of artists after they discovered the AI image generator Stable Diffusion had been trained on 5 billion images scraped from the web (LAION dataset), including their own artworks, without any permission<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup><sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="legal-and-ethical-tensions">Legal and Ethical Tensions</h3>

<p>Legally, the question of whether using copyrighted data for AI training is “fair use” or infringement is still being decided. In a February 2025 decision, a U.S. court (<strong>Thomson Reuters v. ROSS</strong>) held that wholesale copying of a competitor’s copyrighted material (legal case summaries from Westlaw) to train an AI research tool was not fair use<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup><sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The judge noted that the AI in that case wasn’t even a generative model, but a search tool that repackaged the original texts, directly harming the copyright owner’s market<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>. While generative AI may muddy the waters (since outputs aren’t verbatim copies, but can be derivative in style or content), the legal trend suggests courts are wary of unfettered, unlicensed use of copyrighted datasets.</p>

<h3 id="toward-solutions--consent-and-transparency">Toward Solutions – Consent and Transparency</h3>

<p>Policymakers are starting to respond. The draft <strong>EU AI Act</strong> includes provisions that AI developers must disclose any copyrighted material used in training their models<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup><sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>. European lawmakers explicitly added a requirement that generative AI systems like ChatGPT publish summaries of the copyrighted data they were trained on, aiming to introduce transparency and enable rightsholders to claim misuse<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="training-data-and-bias">Training Data and Bias</h2>

<p>The ancient maxim “garbage in, garbage out” gets a silicon makeover here. Feed an AI dodgy data and you’ll get dodgy decisions—only faster and at scale.</p>

<h3 id="opaque-datasets-and-hidden-biases">Opaque Datasets and Hidden Biases</h3>

<p>Many advanced AI models are trained on colossal datasets that are not fully disclosed to the public or regulators. For instance, when OpenAI released GPT-4 in 2023, it notably provided <strong>no details</strong> about the model’s architecture, training methods, or dataset composition, citing competition and safety concerns<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup>.</p>

<p>While trade secrecy is understandable, this opacity has a direct ethical impact: without knowing what data an AI was trained on, it’s “impossible to evaluate” what biases or blind spots might be built into it<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="bias-in-bias-out--examples">Bias in, Bias Out – Examples</h3>

<p>When biased data goes in, discriminatory outcomes come out. A notorious example was <strong>Amazon’s AI recruiting tool</strong>, an algorithm developed to screen resumes. It was trained on ten years of past hiring data – which were skewed toward male candidates (reflecting the tech industry’s male dominance)<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup><sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The AI “taught itself” that male applicants were preferable and began penalising resumes that mentioned “women’s” (as in “women’s chess club”), and downgrading graduates of women’s colleges<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>. In effect, the system became sexist, systematically filtering out qualified women. Amazon’s engineers tried to correct the specific flags, but they couldn’t guarantee the AI wouldn’t find new ways to discriminate, so the project was eventually scrapped<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup><sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Another well-documented case is in criminal justice: risk assessment algorithms used by courts to predict reoffending have exhibited racial bias. ProPublica’s famous 2016 investigation into the <strong>COMPAS system</strong> found that black defendants were falsely labeled “high risk” at nearly twice the rate of white defendants, while white defendants were more frequently mislabeled as low risk<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="the-silicon-valley-ethos-and-the-drive-to-innovate">The Silicon Valley Ethos and the Drive to Innovate</h2>

<p>Silicon Valley’s original mantra—”move fast and break things”—is all fun and games until the “things” include society.</p>

<h3 id="from-motto-to-liability">From Motto to Liability</h3>

<p>In the startup heyday, “move fast and break things” was celebrated as a recipe for disrupting incumbents and achieving technological leaps. However, when it comes to AI systems that can affect millions of lives, this approach can be dangerously reckless. A recent poll found that <strong>72% of Americans prefer AI development to slow down</strong> with more guardrails, versus only 8% who want it to speed up<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup><sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>.</p>

<p>High-profile mishaps have validated these fears: from chatbots that went awry spouting misinformation or hate, to social networks unleashing algorithms that amplified societal divisions. The “launch now, fix later” mentality is being increasingly questioned.</p>

<h3 id="profit-driven-innovation-and-moral-hazard">Profit-Driven Innovation and Moral Hazard</h3>

<p>Silicon Valley’s ecosystem runs on venture capital and the promise of massive profits. This can incentivise a single-minded focus on growth metrics and market capture, potentially overshadowing ethical considerations. AI has become a competitive arms race among tech giants and startups, with enormous financial stakes – which can lead to corners being cut.</p>

<p>Gary Marcus observed a “moral descent” in Big Tech: as companies grew more powerful and profitable, “the desire to do good decreases… in the quest for growth”<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>. He argues that many firms talk about altruistic missions, but in recent years have prioritised profit maximisation at the expense of users and society<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="uses-and-misuses-of-ai">Uses and Misuses of AI</h2>

<p>AI is a dual-use tool: the same algorithms that power beneficial applications can be misappropriated for malicious or harmful ends.</p>

<h3 id="ai-in-social-media-deepfakes-and-algorithmic-amplification">AI in Social Media: Deepfakes and Algorithmic Amplification</h3>

<h4 id="deepfakes-and-misinformation">Deepfakes and Misinformation</h4>

<p>Deepfakes are hyper-realistic fake videos or audio generated by AI, often depicting someone saying or doing things they never did. In the wrong hands, deepfakes can be a potent weapon for misinformation, political propaganda, or personal harassment.</p>

<p>A striking statistic: an analysis in 2023 found that <strong>98% of deepfake videos online were pornographic</strong>, targeting women in 99% of cases<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>. In other words, the vast majority of deepfakes globally consist of non-consensual sexual images – typically a woman’s face superimposed on explicit content – effectively a high-tech form of revenge porn or voyeurism.</p>

<h4 id="algorithmic-amplification-of-harmful-content">Algorithmic Amplification of Harmful Content</h4>

<p>Social media algorithms – the content recommendation AIs on Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, etc. – determine what billions of people see in their feeds. Their optimisation for engagement can lead to the amplification of extreme or harmful content, creating echo chambers and fueling polarisation.</p>

<p>Facebook’s own algorithm changes were found to preferentially boost content that sparked anger or intense reactions, which tended to be divisive posts or misinformation, thus contributing to a more toxic discourse<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup><sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="fraud-and-scams-voice-cloning-and-phishing-automation">Fraud and Scams: Voice Cloning and Phishing Automation</h3>

<h4 id="voice-cloning-and-imposter-scams">Voice Cloning and “Imposter” Scams</h4>

<p>Scammers have begun exploiting trust by using AI to clone voices from just a short recording. In one chilling case, an Arizona mother received a call that mimicked her 15-year-old daughter’s voice perfectly, sobbing that she’d been kidnapped and begging for help<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup><sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>. The voice and cries were so convincing that the mother was certain it was her child – the scammers demanded a ransom, threatening violence. It turned out the daughter was safe; the entire call was a hoax using an AI-generated voice.</p>

<p>A survey by security firm McAfee found <strong>70% of people said they might not distinguish a cloned voice from the real thing</strong>, and alarmingly, today’s AI needs only about <strong>3 seconds of audio sample</strong> to reproduce a person’s voice with high fidelity<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="ai-generated-phishing-and-fraudulent-content">AI-Generated Phishing and Fraudulent Content</h4>

<p>Phishing emails – those fraudulent messages that try to trick you into giving passwords or money – have been around for decades, but AI is supercharging their quality and quantity. With AI language models, a scammer can now generate tailored, grammatically perfect, and context-specific messages by the hundreds.</p>

<p>Europol (the EU’s police agency) warned in 2023 that ChatGPT’s ability to produce highly realistic text with ease makes it a powerful tool for criminals<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="surveillance-and-policing">Surveillance and Policing</h2>

<p>AI technologies are increasingly employed in surveillance and law enforcement, raising profound ethical issues around privacy, civil liberties, accuracy, and potential abuse of power.</p>

<h3 id="mass-surveillance-and-privacy-erosion">Mass Surveillance and Privacy Erosion</h3>

<p>In authoritarian contexts especially, AI-powered surveillance has been used to oppress and control populations. The starkest example is <strong>Xinjiang, China</strong>, where an estimated million-plus Uyghur Muslims have been subjected to high-tech repression. The Chinese government has deployed a “high-tech network of surveillance” in the region, including ubiquitous cameras with facial recognition, mandatory biometric data collection (DNA, iris scans), and phone/computer data monitoring – all fed into AI systems that flag “suspicious” behaviour<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Even outside such extreme cases, the spread of facial recognition in public spaces is blurring the line between security and privacy. There have been at least three known wrongful arrests of Black individuals in the US due to faulty face recognition matches<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup><sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup>. One case was <strong>Robert Williams in Detroit</strong>: facial recognition misidentified him as a suspect, leading to his arrest and jailing for a crime he didn’t commit. Detroit later settled his lawsuit with a $300k payment and agreed to change its policies<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup><sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="predictive-policing-and-bias">Predictive Policing and Bias</h3>

<p>Another use of AI in law enforcement is predictive analytics – algorithms that analyse crime data to predict where crimes might occur or who might be involved. While it might sound objective, these systems can perpetuate existing biases in policing data. “Bias in, bias out” applies strongly here.</p>

<p>Simply put, if your AI might ruin someone’s life, double-check it.</p>

<h2 id="employment-hiring-and-workplace-monitoring">Employment, Hiring, and Workplace Monitoring</h2>

<h3 id="ai-in-hiring--fairness-and-transparency">AI in Hiring – Fairness and Transparency</h3>

<p>Companies are increasingly using AI tools to screen job applicants, parse resumes, or even conduct video interviews with algorithmic analysis of facial expressions and tone. The promise is efficiency and objectivity; the peril is encoding bias and opacity in how employment decisions are made.</p>

<p>This lack of transparency and potential for discrimination has prompted regulatory attention. The <strong>EU AI Act</strong> will treat AI in employment as “high-risk,” requiring that such systems be proven non-discriminatory, transparent, and subject to human oversight<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup><sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="workplace-monitoring-and-algorithmic-management">Workplace Monitoring and “Algorithmic Management”</h3>

<p>Employers have always monitored performance, but AI takes it to new levels of intrusiveness and automation. <strong>Amazon</strong> is the poster child of this trend: in its warehouses, an AI-driven system tracks each worker’s productivity in real time – items scanned, packing speed, “time off task” down to the minute<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup><sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If a worker’s metrics fall below a target, the system will automatically generate warnings and even termination notices without a manager’s input<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup><sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup>. Documents revealed that over a little more than a year, a single Amazon warehouse fired about <strong>300 employees (10% of staff)</strong> purely for productivity shortfalls as decided by this automated system<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup><sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="military-and-geopolitical-applications">Military and Geopolitical Applications</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most grave domain of AI ethics is its use in warfare and geopolitical power struggles. AI is becoming integral to military systems, intelligence analysis, and autonomous weapons – raising existential questions about lethal decision-making by machines and the stability of global peace.</p>

<h3 id="autonomous-weapons-killer-robots">Autonomous Weapons (“Killer Robots”)</h3>

<p>One of the biggest debates is over <strong>Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS)</strong> – weapons that can select and engage targets without human intervention. The ethical issues here are immense. First, there’s the question of human control: delegating life-and-death decisions to algorithms arguably crosses a moral line, as machines lack human judgment, empathy, and accountability<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup><sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Because of these issues, over 30 countries and numerous NGOs have called for a preemptive ban on killer robots (through campaigns like “Stop Killer Robots”), akin to bans on chemical or biological weapons. In 2015, thousands of AI researchers signed an open letter warning that autonomous weapons could be “the third revolution in warfare” (after gunpowder and nuclear arms)<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="ai-arms-race-and-geopolitical-tensions">AI Arms Race and Geopolitical Tensions</h3>

<p>We are witnessing an AI arms race in a broader sense: countries pouring resources into military AI for intelligence, cyber warfare, and autonomous systems. This race raises geopolitical ethical questions: will AI make wars more likely by giving some nations confidence in quick, decisive tech-driven victory?</p>

<h2 id="regulatory-outlook">Regulatory Outlook</h2>

<p>The ethical implications of AI span the environmental to the existential. A few clear themes emerge:</p>

<h3 id="transparency-and-accountability">Transparency and Accountability</h3>

<p>Whether it’s training data composition, model decision-making, or AI usage in hiring/policing, openness is critical. We’ve seen that when AI operates as a black box, trust erodes and harms go unmitigated. The <strong>EU’s AI Act</strong> is a significant step in this direction, introducing traceability and oversight requirements<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup><sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="fairness-and-human-centric-design">Fairness and Human-Centric Design</h3>

<p>AI must be designed and deployed to augment human capabilities and decision-making, not to entrench inequalities or replace human values. The concept of <strong>AI ethics by design</strong> is gaining traction – similar to privacy by design – where equity and fairness checks are baked into the development process from the start.</p>

<h3 id="empowerment-vs-control">Empowerment vs. Control</h3>

<p>There is a fundamental tension between AI’s use to empower users/workers/citizens and its use to control or manipulate them. Ethical AI development leans towards empowerment – using AI to help rather than surveil; giving users more control rather than covertly nudging their behaviour.</p>

<h3 id="global-collaboration-and-norms">Global Collaboration and Norms</h3>

<p>AI’s challenges are global – carbon emitted in one country warms the whole planet; a deepfake in one language can influence another country’s politics; an arms race benefits no nation in the end. Thus, global governance and cooperation are key.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-oversight-and-adaptation">Continuous Oversight and Adaptation</h3>

<p>AI technology evolves quickly. Ethical and regulatory approaches must be agile and updated regularly. One innovative idea is the creation of <strong>AI oversight bodies</strong> – national or regional “AI Agencies” that specialise in monitoring AI developments and advising on policy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Finally, it’s worth emphasising the human element. AI, for all the talk of autonomy, ultimately reflects human choices – in what objectives we set, what data we feed it, and where we apply it. As AI becomes more powerful, those choices have ever greater impact.</p>

<p>It falls on us – developers, policymakers, business leaders, and society at large – to wield AI in service of human dignity, equity, and prosperity. As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. AI is indeed great power. This article has highlighted some of the responsibilities that come with it.</p>

<p>Navigating the ethical challenges will not be easy, but with informed, global and multidisciplinary engagement, we can ensure AI remains a tool for good – amplifying the best of human ingenuity, not the worst of our biases or greed.</p>

<p><strong>In the end, AI is merely a mirror for human choices—albeit a gigantic, turbo-charged one. With vigilance and humility, we might just keep the mirror cracked but functional rather than shattered.</strong></p>

<h2 id="how-british-universities-keep-tripping-over-their-own-mortarboards-on-the-way-to-saving-15-billion">How British Universities Keep Tripping over Their Own Mortarboards on the way to saving £1.5 billion</h2>

<p>Back in my previous dispatch I suggested—straight-faced, honest—that if UK universities would only stop elbowing one another in the ribs and buy a few mundane things together, they could shave something like <strong>£1.5 billion</strong> off the national higher-education bill. The reaction ranged from polite throat-clearing to the sort of laughter usually reserved for a vice-chancellor announcing he’s discovered student satisfaction.</p>

<p>The immediate retort goes like this:
<em>“We’d love to hold hands, but our royal charter won’t let us. Also, league-table season is coming and we really must focus on us.”</em></p>

<p>So let’s open the creaking oak doors, dust off the parchment and ask what the founding documents actually say about cooperation.</p>

<h2 id="the-myth-of-the-insular-charter">The Myth of the Insular Charter</h2>

<p>Take the University of Bath’s charter, a 1960s vintage as modern as student-union posters of Che Guevara. Article 3(s) empowers the institution “to co-operate … with other Universities and Authorities … for such other purposes as the University may from time to time determine.” Warwick’s near-identical clause, drafted the same year, even supplies the helpful phrase “by means of joint boards.” Medievalists may prefer the Oxford &amp; Cambridge Act 1571, which bestows on both universities every liberty “tending to the better increase of learning”—Elizabeth I’s sixteenth-century way of saying <em>crack on, lads.</em></p>

<p>None of these charters obliges a university to conduct its own payroll service or procure detergent solo. Quite the reverse: they hand trustees a broad corporate power and then ask only that they pursue the public benefit. Under the Charities Act 2011 that means spending money sensibly, ideally on students and research rather than twenty-seven slightly different contracts for electricity.</p>

<p>Even the Higher Education &amp; Research Act 2017—the statute that regulates everything from fee caps to whether a lecture capture counts as a miracle—stays studiously silent on joint purchasing, save for encouraging the Office for Students to share information “with any person”. In regulatory terms, the road to collaboration is as clear as a deserted library at dawn.</p>

<h2 id="evidence-that-it-works-when-we-can-be-bothered">Evidence that it Works (when We Can Be bothered)</h2>

<p>Proof of concept already exists. The eight regional purchasing consortia that make up <strong>UKUPC</strong> cheerfully report cashable savings of <strong>£116 million</strong> a year just on frameworks for IT kit, lab consumables and the sort of biscuits mysteriously labelled “conference”. Jisc, the sector’s collectively owned digital backbone, estimates still bigger efficiencies when universities plug into shared cloud contracts and broadband pipes rather than each reinventing the cable.</p>

<p>In other words, collaboration already happens; it merely stops well short of the tantalising billions.</p>

<h2 id="pyramid-politics">Pyramid Politics</h2>

<p>Why, then, won’t the other ninety per cent of spend toddle into a joint catalogue? Part of the answer lies in higher education’s architectural fetish for pyramids. Each university is a neat hierarchy that tapers to a single point: the vice-chancellor. That apex owns the brand, the risk register and the annual report photograph involving an improbably shiny staircase.</p>

<p>Try persuading two such pyramids to overlap and, like amateur Egyptologists, you discover the points refuse to tessellate. The apexes bang together; nobody is quite sure whose logo appears first; and before long a worried registrar starts muttering about autonomy while clutching the league-table supplement.</p>

<p>Besides, competition is deliciously flattering. Nothing strokes an institutional ego like out-bidding the red-brick down the road for a star professor, or opening a “satellite campus” two postcodes closer to the M25. Cooperation, by contrast, is the social-science equivalent of cardigan weather: worthy, but unlikely to win you an alumni gala.</p>

<h2 id="the-cultural-cul-de-sac">The Cultural Cul-de-sac</h2>

<p>Culture, not charter, is therefore the choke-point. The sector talks a good game about collegiality—<em>academic Senate</em>, <em>Common Room</em>, that sort of thing—yet behaves, fiscally speaking, like a family arguing over the last roast potato. Every pound saved together is a pound that fails to show up in <em>our</em> margin this year, and heaven forfend the governing council should peer admiringly at someone else’s balance sheet.</p>

<p>The result is a kind of accidental feudalism. Twelve separate payroll offices survive because shutting eleven of them requires a committee vote in each fiefdom. Entire fleets of minivans dutifully ply their solitary routes because nobody wants to ride in a rival’s livery. And so the collective chequebook remains locked in a cabinet labelled <em>Strategic Autonomy</em> even while bursars complain about electricity prices.</p>

<h2 id="can-the-points-be-joined">Can the Points Be Joined?</h2>

<p>The optimistic answer is yes, but the job is more joinery than geometry. Instead of squashing pyramids together, one builds a platform—call it a moat, since we appear stuck in the Middle Ages anyway—and lets each pyramid lower a drawbridge when it fancies cheap stationery. Jisc’s broadband, the UKUPC frameworks: these are moats already in place, proving the concept works provided nobody insists on repainting the water.</p>

<p>What remains is political courage. It will take a vice-chancellor bold enough to admit that another university’s procurement officer occasionally knows a bargain when she sees one. It will take governing bodies willing to measure prestige in research outputs rather than how many branded pens sit in the storeroom. And it will take the OfS to applaud savings with the same fervour it reserves for access plans and TEF medals.</p>

<h2 id="a-modest-proposal-sans-brass-band">A Modest Proposal (sans Brass band)</h2>

<p>Release a sector-wide mandate: any back-office contract worth more than the average professorial salary must first be tendered through a shared framework. No compulsion to buy together—simply an obligation to <em>see</em> the price of solidarity before signing the solo deal. If the saving is real (spoiler: it will be) the pyramid will, in time, build its own drawbridge.</p>

<p>Do that and the £1.5 billion I waved about earlier stops looking like a whimsical footnote and starts resembling the future pension contributions for an entire generation of early-career academics. Suddenly cooperation isn’t woolly altruism; it’s enlightened self-interest—which, incidentally, is exactly what every charter was written to promote.</p>

<p>The ancient statutes did not force us into perpetual single-player mode. We chose that path, puffed up by league tables and institutional lore. The sooner we remember that the public benefit is collective, the sooner we can stop balancing the books on the shoulders of students and junior staff, and start spending the savings on something radical—like teaching.</p>

<p>Until then the pyramids will stand aloof, apexes glinting, each convinced it is the tallest in the desert, none quite noticing how much sand is slipping through the cracks.</p>]]></content><author><name>Justin O'Brien</name></author><category term="higher-education" /><category term="collaboration" /><category term="procurement" /><category term="university-cooperation" /><category term="shared-services" /><category term="UKUPC" /><category term="institutional-culture" /><category term="university-autonomy" /><category term="cost-savings" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[UK universities could save £1.5 billion through collaboration, but pyramid politics and cultural feudalism keep them competing over stationery while students foot the bill.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4001/assets/images/posts/2025-07-10-why-cant-we-be-friends/hero-university-cooperation.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4001/assets/images/posts/2025-07-10-why-cant-we-be-friends/hero-university-cooperation.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Cheaper, Easier, Efficienter?

<h2 id="the-never-ending-hunt-for-a-bargain">The Never-Ending Hunt for a Bargain</h2>

<p><strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> nobody ends up bathing in gold coins, but at least the catering’s cheaper.</p>

<h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene</h3>

<p>Back in 2010, ministers decided that what British higher education really needed was the bracing draught of the free market—plus the occasional spreadsheet from a management consultant. Since then, almost every UK university has flirted, dated or gone fully steady with private-sector partners. On paper the romance promised three irresistible benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lower costs</strong> (because cleaners apparently thrive on fresh air and gratitude)</li>
  <li><strong>Improved “efficiencies”</strong> (a word that does heroic work in policy documents)</li>
  <li><strong>A dash of entrepreneurial sparkle</strong> (complete with PowerPoint animations)</li>
</ul>

<p>Fifteen years later, we can ask: who actually made any money? And did anyone remember to turn the lights off when Carillion imploded?</p>

<h2 id="1-outsourcing-the-basics-beans-bins-and-broken-boilers">1. Outsourcing the Basics: Beans, Bins and Broken Boilers</h2>

<p>Campus support services were the first to be handed to the private sector. The logic was simple: specialist firms would run catering, cleaning, IT and security more cheaply than your average university could manage in-house. London Metropolitan University even tried to outsource virtually everything except actual lecturing—although that grand plan soon hit a wall thicker than most dissertations<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Did universities save cash?</strong> For a while, yes. <strong>Did contractors get fabulously rich?</strong> Not exactly. Margins were so slender that giants like Carillion toppled over in 2018, leaving half-finished projects and a nation of bemused vice-chancellors<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus irony:</strong> many outsourced staff discovered they could enjoy lower wages <em>and</em> weaker holiday pay <em>and</em> poorer pensions—proof that modernisation can, indeed, be a triple win (just not necessarily for them).</p>

<h2 id="2-digital-dreams-moocs-opms-and-other-acronyms">2. Digital Dreams: MOOCs, OPMs and Other Acronyms</h2>

<p>When Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) burst onto the scene circa 2012, prophets foretold a future of “frictionless” global education. The Open University duly launched FutureLearn; venture capital flowed; and newspapers welcomed “the end of the campus” (again).</p>

<p>Alas, FutureLearn managed to burn through cash at roughly the speed of a freshers’-week overdraft, racking up multi-million-pound losses before being sold off like a slightly scuffed laptop on Facebook Marketplace<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Online Programme Management (OPM) companies</strong>—those nice people who promise to design your master’s degree, recruit your students and then split the fees 50/50—multiplied faster than seagulls near chips. By 2023 there were almost 50 UK OPM partnerships<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Sadly, negative financial results also multiplied. Pearson, sensing a party turning awkward, paid a private-equity outfit to take its ailing OPM arm off its hands<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Industry analysts now describe the traditional OPM market as “in freefall”, which is consultant-speak for “bring a parachute”<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="3-pathway-and-occasionally-slipway-colleges">3. Pathway (and Occasionally Slipway) Colleges</h2>

<p>Nothing says global Britain like outsourcing your foundation year to a for-profit joint venture. Firms such as INTO, Study Group and Navitas set up “embedded” colleges right on campus to recruit and teach international students. Universities liked the steady pipeline of tuition; investors liked the steady pipeline of, well, tuition.</p>

<p><strong>Reality, however, proved trickier.</strong> Several INTO ventures haemorrhaged cash, survived only on university loans or shut down entirely. INTO’s London branch with UEA cost the university millions before the plug was pulled<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Staff enjoyed lower pay, students occasionally enjoyed lower entry standards, and auditors enjoyed wondering where all the money had gone.</p>

<h2 id="4-private-universities-and-the-great-gsm-london-meltdown">4. Private Universities and the Great GSM London Meltdown</h2>

<p>The government also invited wholly private universities to join the fray. BPP University and the University of Law still stand, but others fared less handsomely. The collapse of GSM London in 2019 left 3,500 students hunting for new courses and demonstrated that “challenging market conditions” is polite code for “we ran out of cash”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Regulators have since developed a keen interest in preventing more such episodes, chiefly to avoid headlines involving stranded undergraduates and smouldering piles of student-loan money.</p>

<h2 id="5-where-the-money-is-student-accommodation">5. Where the Money Is: Student Accommodation</h2>

<p>One area has minted profits: <strong>purpose-built student housing</strong>. Firms like Unite Students and UPP erect shiny new halls, charge eye-watering rents, and report earnings that make the average OPM executive sob quietly into their latte. Unite’s pre-tax profit quadrupled to £444 million in 2022<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>, which is almost enough to afford the rent on one of its deluxe ensuite studios in Zone 1 (plus maybe a kettle).</p>

<p><strong>Why does this work when other ventures flop?</strong> Simple: the revenue comes straight from students’ wallets, the product is literal bricks and mortar, and no one has to mark essays at 3 a.m.</p>

<h2 id="6-the-consultants-the-software-and-everyone-else">6. The Consultants, the Software and Everyone Else</h2>

<p>Elsewhere, ed-tech vendors (Turnitin, Blackboard, assorted proctoring start-ups) have done rather nicely by charging annual licences and letting academics argue about plagiarism in their spare time. Management-consultancy firms, meanwhile, discovered that universities are prepared to pay handsomely for PowerPoints advising them to “do more with less” and “unlock stakeholder synergies”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>.</p>

<p>There is no recorded instance of McKinsey going bust because a vice-chancellor drove too hard a bargain.</p>

<h2 id="drawing-a-wobbly-bottom-line">Drawing a (Wobbly) Bottom Line</h2>

<p>After a decade-plus of experimentation, the ledger looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Campus outsourcing:</strong> minor savings for universities, major headaches for suppliers, existential dread for cleaners</li>
  <li><strong>Online education:</strong> technological utopia postponed; investors queue here for refunds</li>
  <li><strong>Pathway colleges:</strong> profits highly dependent on immigration rules, exchange rates and luck</li>
  <li><strong>Private universities:</strong> some winners, several spectacular losers</li>
  <li><strong>Student accommodation:</strong> champagne all round (unless you’re paying the rent)</li>
  <li><strong>Consultants &amp; software vendors:</strong> steady as she goes, thanks very much</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, privatisation has certainly sprinkled higher education with market forces. It just hasn’t sprinkled everyone with money. Universities shaved costs here and there; employees often absorbed the haircut; and many private firms discovered that teaching, supporting and housing students is fiendishly expensive—unless you own the halls, in which case it’s rather cosy.</p>

<p><strong>The next time someone breezily promises “efficiencies” courtesy of a shiny new partnership, remember:</strong> in academia, as in life, you rarely get something for nothing. Except, of course, PowerPoint animations. Those are apparently free.</p>

<p>In recent posts I’ve already skipped indelicately through Britain’s higher-education money-pit, tutted at missed savings, and poked the soggy bits of management. “Cheer up,” I promised. So naturally it’s time to talk about death.
Not yours, happily, but the demise of an entire university – a topic so bleak it makes actuarial tables look frisky.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-warning-lights-that-no-one-reads">1. The Warning Lights That No One Reads</h2>

<p>Contrary to tabloid folklore, a UK university cannot simply press CTRL-ALT-DELETE and vanish. The Office for Students (OfS), our sector’s all-seeing eye, monitors every provider’s cash-flow forecasts like a helicopter parent reading WhatsApp. The moment liquidity drops to roughly a month’s pocket money, OfS may slap on “specific conditions” – think: “No, you may <strong>not</strong> build another glass atrium while the payroll’s on fire.”</p>

<p>Should things wobble further, OfS issues a <strong>Student Protection Direction</strong>: a legally enforceable market-exit plan explaining where the students will finish their degrees once the lights go out. It is, in effect, a fire-drill for higher education, minus the jaunty hi-vis jackets.</p>

<h2 id="2-rescue-attempts-before-the-undertaker-arrives">2. Rescue Attempts Before the Undertaker Arrives</h2>

<p><strong>Internal surgery.</strong> Governing bodies usually start by freezing head-count, flogging spare buildings, and axing under-subscribed courses. Given that three-quarters of English universities expect deficits in 2025-26, this is becoming less “remedy” and more “morning routine”.</p>

<p><strong>Tough-love funding.</strong> During Covid the Department for Education ran the <strong>Higher Education Restructuring Regime (HERR)</strong>: loans with strings, the strings mainly involving painful governance reform or outright merger. HERR has now retired to the policy graveyard, but ministers still keep a bail-out defibrillator handy – heavily conditional and rarely charged.</p>

<p><strong>Voluntary mergers.</strong> OfS positively encourages courtship. Universities UK even has a matchmaking task-force roaming the sector like a polite dating app. Recent hook-ups include Northeastern’s absorption of New College of the Humanities, and the serial mergers in Wales that birthed the University of Wales Trinity Saint David.
Do note: under charity law this is a transfer of assets, not a sale, so no one gets a yacht out of it.</p>

<h2 id="3-when-the-pulse-flat-lines-formal-insolvency">3. When the Pulse Flat-Lines: Formal Insolvency</h2>

<p>There is, amazingly, <strong>no bespoke higher-education insolvency regime</strong>. Instead, which procedural rabbit-hole you tumble down depends on your constitutional birth-certificate:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Companies limited by guarantee or for-profit outfits</strong> go through mainstream administration, CVA or liquidation. Exhibit A: GSM London (2019) folded, and its students finished degrees elsewhere.</li>
  <li><strong>Higher-Education Corporations</strong> (post-92 universities) face a statutory <strong>Dissolution Order</strong>: the Secretary of State orders assets transferred to another HE provider or charity. No one has pressed this big red button yet.</li>
  <li><strong>Royal-Charter universities</strong> can be wound up only as “unregistered companies” in court – or they may politely surrender their charter to the Privy Council. Insolvency lawyers say either route would lock the campus faster than you can mutter “asset freeze”.</li>
</ul>

<p>In all cases, once an insolvency practitioner or liquidator is appointed, management’s power evaporates faster than complimentary wine at graduation. Meanwhile, OfS hovers ready to revoke degree-awarding powers if standards slip.</p>

<h2 id="4-whose-assets-are-they-anyway">4. Whose Assets Are They Anyway?</h2>

<p>Here’s the twist: much of a university’s estate is held on permanent endowment or special trusts. Endowments, archives, the chapel, the embarrassing early portraits – all are effectively coated in charitable Teflon, untouchable by ordinary creditors unless the Charity Commission or a court approves a re-purpose.
Secured lenders may still repossess student accommodation or the shiny conference centre, but the quadrangle and silver Mace are destined for another charity, not a bank’s balance sheet.</p>

<h2 id="5-students-and-staff-the-human-bits">5. Students and Staff: The Human Bits</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Teach-out or transfer.</strong> Student Protection Plans outline where learners will complete their degrees. The plan is usually dull but reassuring, much like the in-flight safety card.</li>
  <li><strong>Redundancies.</strong> Staff wages rank as preferential debts, which sounds comforting until one remembers the pension deficit lurking behind the sofa. Eligible schemes tip into the Pension Protection Fund; others hope for better reincarnation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6-five-things-every-linkedin-sage-should-remember">6. Five Things Every LinkedIn Sage Should Remember</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Bankruptcy is rare, not mythical.</strong> Company-form providers may use Insolvency Act tools; chartered universities need court or Privy Council theatrics.</li>
  <li><strong>Bail-outs come with handcuffs.</strong> Expect governance reform, course closures and the odd forced marriage before any public money appears.</li>
  <li><strong>Mergers are the sector’s escape hatch.</strong> Assets glide across under charity law, teaching continues, and everyone pretends it was always meant to be.</li>
  <li><strong>Charitable status is an asset force-field.</strong> Endowments and heritage estates survive creditors, however ravenous.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed matters.</strong> Once cash-days-in-hand sinks below the OfS danger zone, outside control is only a board-paper away.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="and-finally-a-glimmer-of-optimism">And Finally… a Glimmer of Optimism</h2>

<p>Yes, a university can die – but it usually doesn’t. More often it slims down, pairs up, or accepts a stern talking-to and staggers on with renewed purpose. The sector’s safety nets may be bureaucratic spaghetti, yet they exist precisely so that students finish degrees, staff keep lecturing, and the library cat retains employment.</p>

<p>So if your institution’s balance sheet currently resembles a student overdraft, worry – but not too much. Don’t be like me. Instead, pick up the phone, open the books, and start negotiating <strong>while the choice is still yours</strong>. With luck, the only funeral you’ll attend is for the CFO’s cherished vanity project – and nobody will miss that at all.</p>]]></content><author><name>Justin O'Brien</name></author><category term="higher-education" /><category term="university-governance" /><category term="insolvency" /><category term="university-closure" /><category term="OfS-regulation" /><category term="insolvency-law" /><category term="student-protection" /><category term="UK-universities" /><category term="institutional-failure" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A UK university cannot simply press CTRL-ALT-DELETE and vanish.

<p>Picture, if you will, a university. Towers of stained glass or brutalist concrete, professors in tweed, coffee queues that never move, and somewhere deep inside a committee discussing the minutes of a committee that discussed the minutes of a committee. Now ask the seemingly innocent question, “So, who owns this place?” After a brief silence you will hear a faint pop as the notion of <em>ownership</em> packs its bags and leaves the building.</p>

<h2 id="ownership-the-short-answer-there-isnt-any">Ownership: the Short Answer (There Isn’t Any)</h2>

<p>Universities in the United Kingdom belong to exactly the same person who owns Stonehenge, St Paul’s Cathedral and the Shipping Forecast: <strong>nobody in particular and everyone in theory</strong>. They are <em>corporations sole</em> or <em>charitable bodies</em> conjured into existence by Royal Charter, Act of Parliament or, in more recent ventures, Companies House paperwork so thick it could stun a yak. They do not issue shares, pay dividends or hand the keys to anyone who fancies flipping them for a quick profit. Think of them as legally recognised stray cats—magnificent, slightly aloof, and impossible to sell on eBay.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-taxonomy-of-academic-creatures">A Brief Taxonomy of Academic Creatures</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The Charter Brigade</strong> – Oxford, Cambridge and other medieval antiques granted life by monarchs who thought indoor plumbing was sorcery. Their charters are amended only slightly faster than plate tectonics.</li>
  <li><strong>The Polytechnic Posse</strong> – rebadged as universities in 1992 and technically “Higher Education Corporations.” Same academic aspirations, just with better signage and more acronyms.</li>
  <li><strong>The Limited-by-Guarantee Gang</strong> – the newest kids on the quad, wrapped up in company law but still charitable, so no one gets to drive off in a Lamborghini funded by the library fines.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each tribe has its own governance rituals, but all share one mystical vow: <em>Thou shalt pursue education and research for the public benefit, even when the Treasury forgets thy postcode.</em></p>

<h2 id="enter-the-office-for-students-no-really-thats-the-name">Enter the Office for Students (No, Really, That’s the Name)</h2>

<p>When ministers merged the late HEFCE with a consumer watchdog, they could have christened the result the “Office for Higher Education” or even “OfUni”. Instead we got <strong>OfS</strong>, which sounds less like a regulator and more like the room where lost undergraduates go to cry. The branding is deliberate: government wanted to imply that universities are mere suppliers in a plucky student marketplace. In practice OfS spends its days checking whether institutions still meet charitable objects and haven’t accidentally set fire to their balance sheets. Imagine Ofgem, but with more Latin mottos and fewer hard hats.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-university-is-not-a-school-a-college-or-heaven-forfend-a-private-firm">Why a University Is <em>Not</em> a School, a College, or (Heaven Forfend) a Private Firm</h2>

<p>Schools and further-education colleges live on a steady diet of Department-for-Education directives, Ofsted inspections and well-meaning PowerPoints about “governance maturity.” Universities, by contrast, are <strong>self-owning, self-policing and occasionally self-destructive</strong>. Their governing councils hold the deeds, write the strategies and endure the grand opera of academic senate debates. Attempting to run them like a multi-academy trust is about as sensible as herding cats with a tuba.</p>

<p>Conversely, treating universities as if they were listed companies—complete with quarterly earnings calls and “synergy roadmaps”—is the sort of policy idea that should come with a child-safety cap. Shareholders can flog Pizza Express if it underperforms; a university can’t flog its Chemistry Department on a wet Wednesday in Hull. Its assets are <em>locked</em> to charitable purpose. You might monetise car-parking, but flogging Erasmus Darwin’s microscope on Etsy is definitely off the menu.</p>

<h3 id="things-a-university-isnt">Things a University <em>Isn’t</em></h3>

<ul>
  <li>A profit-spitting machine whose raison d’être is shareholder value.</li>
  <li>A branch campus of Whitehall where ministers can rearrange the furniture on Fridays.</li>
  <li>A giant school that closes at 3 p.m. and hands out gold stars for punctuality.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-perils-of-competitive-market-daydreams">The Perils of Competitive-Market Daydreams</h2>

<p>Proponents of full-throttle competition argue that if we just let price signals roam free, vice-chancellors would miraculously become Jeff Bezos in mortar-boards. Reality check: higher education markets are sticky, brand-driven and internationally entangled. A university can’t relocate to Shenzhen if the local council hikes business rates. Nor can it ruthlessly axe “unprofitable segments” without inviting a small riot on campus followed by parliamentary questions about regional levelling-up. There is, in short, <strong>no clearance aisle for astrophysics</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-does-work">So What <em>Does</em> Work?</h2>

<p>Governance that remembers the institution is a <strong>public-benefit charity first, educational powerhouse second and investment portfolio last</strong>. Sensible engagement with government—because shouting “academic freedom!” while ignoring audit letters rarely ends well. And, yes, trimming the management-speak (no one knows what a “transformative learner journey ecosystem” is, including the person who wrote it).</p>

<h3 id="five-blunt-take-aways-for-anyone-tempted-to-fix-universities">Five Blunt Take-aways for Anyone Tempted to “Fix” Universities</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>You can’t sell them.</strong> Not even to Elon Musk.</li>
  <li><strong>You can’t close them like branch libraries.</strong> Royal Charters have longer half-lives than plutonium.</li>
  <li><strong>You can’t bully them into acting like widget factories.</strong> Knowledge doesn’t scale on Amazon Web Services.</li>
  <li><strong>You can nudge them—carefully—through funding strings and regulatory carrots.</strong> Heavy sticks usually snap.</li>
  <li><strong>Most of what looks like inefficiency is actually the cost of safeguarding independence, curiosity and the occasional Nobel Prize.</strong> Deal with it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-punchline">The Punchline</h2>

<p>Universities are strange, ancient, gloriously inefficient organisms designed to preserve and create knowledge long after this year’s buzzwords have faded. Try to run them like a sixth-form college and you’ll crush the serendipity that makes research happen. Try to run them like Waterstone’s and you’ll soon discover that philosophy departments are spectacularly loss-making—right up until they generate the ethical framework that saves humanity from its own AI.</p>

<p>So the next time someone suggests “rationalising the sector,” ask whether they’ve ever tried rationalising a cathedral or a grand piano. Some things owe their lasting value precisely to the fact that nobody owns them, and universities—awkward, argumentative and occasionally sublime—are at the top of that wonderfully inconvenient list.</p>]]></content><author><name>Justin O'Brien</name></author><category term="higher-education" /><category term="governance" /><category term="policy" /><category term="university-ownership" /><category term="charitable-status" /><category term="royal-charter" /><category term="governance" /><category term="OfS" /><category term="university-autonomy" /><category term="public-benefit" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Universities belong to exactly the same person who owns Stonehenge and the Shipping Forecast: nobody in particular and everyone in theory.

<p>Having previously moaned about government support (lack thereof), the parochial “business models” and ignorance of simple cost savings in UK universities, I now turn to the <em>why</em>. Why are universities incapable of managing themselves efficiently or even rationally?</p>

<p>Part of the reason is that British universities, once bastions of eccentric brilliance held together by chalk dust and tweed, have quietly morphed into Versailles-sized palaces of PowerPoint where nothing happens until someone has convened a stakeholder-engagement workshop—complete with gluten-free muffins.</p>

<h2 id="the-managerial-pyramid-a-curious-growth-industry">The Managerial Pyramid: A Curious Growth Industry</h2>

<p>Between August 2023 and July 2024 our universities added roughly 7,000 new academics, a perfectly civilised three-per-cent increase. Admirable—until you discover that non-academic posts grew almost twice as fast, continuing the decade-long trend charted by HESA. At several Russell Group institutions a mere twenty-one per cent of total spending now lands in anyone’s lecture timetable; the rest vanishes into other operating expenses—marketing campaigns, franchise fees, strategic consultancies and the sort of “digital transformations” that require everyone to use four log-ins where one once sufficed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, vice-chancellors have launched their own space programme. Average remuneration in 2025 eased past £340,000, while a handful of particularly well-nourished incumbents saunter along at closer to £400k once subsidised mansions are thrown in. By comparison, the median lecturer’s real-terms pay has fallen fifteen per cent since 2009. Nothing like a little shared sacrifice to build camaraderie.</p>

<h2 id="bureaucracy-by-design-and-delight">Bureaucracy by Design (and Delight)</h2>

<p>Regulation, like ivy, never sleeps. The Research Excellence Framework devoured £471 million in 2021 and will cheerfully eat another half-a-billion each time the cycle renews. Its younger sibling, the Teaching Excellence Framework, now costs providers about £50 million per outing once one tallies all the compulsory surveys, data returns and 40-page narratives.</p>

<p>Staff morale responds in the predictable fashion: pulse surveys show soaring stress wherever a fresh “compliance document” lands in the inbox. One academic described the annual quality-assurance audit as “the Hunger Games in knitwear”.</p>

<h2 id="financial-cracks-and-educational-fallout">Financial Cracks and Educational Fallout</h2>

<p>Ask the University of Dundee, whose £35 million deficit recently triggered an exodus from the senior leadership suite. When the international-student cash tide recedes, even the grandest managerial pyramids reveal damp foundations. Students notice other tremors too: contact hours squeezed by ballooning class sizes, endless queueing for feedback, libraries that close earlier than budget meetings run late. Early-career researchers, keen on anything resembling a pension, vote with their feet—and sometimes their passports.</p>

<h2 id="lean-lessons-we-imported-then-mislaid">Lean Lessons We Imported, Then Mislaid</h2>

<p>Oddly enough, Britain already ran a successful experiment in <em>less</em> management. Sunderland’s Nissan plant, opened in 1986, matched Japan’s productivity within three years by championing Lean and Kaizen—ideas built on flat structures, relentless small improvements and the heretical belief that the person closest to the work might know something useful about it.</p>

<p>Toyota’s UK team later used the same methods to cut inventory by two-thirds and redirect resources to the front line. British-owned factories that clung to 1950s hierarchies mostly decayed or died.</p>

<h2 id="three-alternative-operating-systems-and-a-health-warning">Three Alternative Operating Systems (and a Health Warning)</h2>

<p><em>First</em>, cast your gaze to the Netherlands, where Buurtzorg’s self-managed nursing teams operate without middle managers, yet somehow deliver stellar outcomes and sky-high job satisfaction. Professional standards remain non-negotiable, but nobody needs thirty signature boxes to requisition a kettle.</p>

<p><em>Second</em>, recall Brazil’s Semco. There, employees famously vote on their bosses’ pay and set departmental budgets in town-hall meetings. Radical? Yes. Effective? Also yes—provided your workforce can decide anything more complex than lunch without descending into civil war.</p>

<p><em>Third</em>, the gaming company Valve ditched titles altogether: people choose projects, desks come on wheels, and the org chart looks like spilled noodles. Innovation gallops. So can informal power networks, so transparency had better ride shotgun.</p>

<p>Each model shares a family resemblance: authority lives near the coalface, not at the summit of Mount Gantt Chart. Academics, who already peer-review one another’s research with merciless glee, might actually thrive here.</p>

<h2 id="what-universities-could-actually-do-tomorrow-morning">What Universities Could <em>Actually</em> Do Tomorrow Morning</h2>

<p><strong>Shrink HQ and empower departments.</strong> Give each department an operating grant and let adults decide how many “learning-technologies partners” they truly need. Every pound unspent on a meeting buys an extra seminar.</p>

<p><strong>Turn audits into Kaizen sprints.</strong> Swap annual 40-page action plans for fortnightly improvement sessions run by the people who teach. Toyota can review a production line before lunch; surely a team of historians can streamline the feedback loop on the Reformation essay.</p>

<p><strong>Publish the executive-to-median salary ratio.</strong> If sunlight is indeed the best disinfectant, broadcast how many lectures could be funded by one deputy pro vice-chancellor’s compensation package. The optics alone might deflate the pyramid faster than any white-paper.</p>

<p><strong>Borrow participatory budgeting.</strong> Let a History cohort decide whether they prefer another administrator or more teaching support. It’s their tuition fee, after all.</p>

<p><strong>Pilot self-managing colleges.</strong> Start with postgraduate research units—small, motivated, already semi-autonomous. Measure completion rates, student satisfaction and cost per credit against centrally micro-managed equivalents. Publish the results, even if they make the senior common room gasp into its sauvignon blanc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“Flat structures may harbour shadow hierarchies, but pyramids advertise theirs in brushed steel on the door.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-brief-nudge-to-the-sceptics">A Brief Nudge to the Sceptics</h2>

<p>Yes, Lean can be abused by stopwatch zealots who time your loo breaks. That is a failure of imagination, not an iron law. And yes, Valve alumni confess that popularity contests lurk in any flatland. The antidote is radical transparency, not the comforting embrace of eighteenth-century titles like <em>Pro-Vice-Assistant-Deputy Dean for Enabling Strategies</em>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-short-we-promised">Conclusion (Short, We Promised)</h2>

<p>Our universities once borrowed the seminar from Germany and the tutorial from Oxford’s medieval guilds. Lifting a few modern governance ideas is hardly sacrilege. Flatten the hierarchy, trust the people who can actually spell <em>phenomenology</em>, and we may yet rediscover that elusive pastime known as scholarship. A slimmer pyramid also leaves more room at the base for students—and rather less space at the top for executive away-days in Provence.</p>

<p>Universities in the UK are in trouble. Big trouble with pound signs.
Student fees are capped - Unis are paying about £3K a year to teach each student
Research is underfunded. Grants pay only about 70 pence of every research pound. Universities are funding their own research.
The once great bastions of soft power, stricter visa regulations have put off international students.</p>

<p>Let’s start with what won’t work.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The government won’t allow a higher fee cap. There’s no way they would allow the fee to pass the £10,000 ceiling given the state of student debt. It needs to go to £12K. This as been obvious since fees were introduced 15 years ago and immediately all universities charged the maximum allowed fee. No sign of “competition” between universities to teach cheaply. Why? ‘cos teaching is expensive when it involves actual teachers.</li>
  <li>The government won’t increase research spending more than a token amount. Never has happened, never will happen.</li>
  <li>The government won’t lift visa restrictions. The situation for international students will likely get worse rather than better.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="whats-been-tried-the-cutting-paradox">What’s Been Tried: The Cutting Paradox</h2>

<p><strong>Cut costs!</strong> Universities spend a lot on people. All kinds of staff. Cut them! Well, that’s what’s happening. What’s the result? A university that cuts say 500 staff across the board will get a short term benefit of saving the balance sheet for a year or two. It’s always more complicated than you’d think because it’s expensive to get rid of people - it’s a drawn out process that involves paying voluntary severances and compulsory redundancy payments. You may be cutting £30m from your annual budget but you also have to find £10m for all these one off payments. But what are the downsides of that short term balance sheet benefit? You have just made your university smaller. Long term your income is going to go down. You’ve done a sudden shrink in response to (widely predicted) circumstances. You can pretend that “efficiencies” and “productivity boosts” will mean you can do more with fewer staff. But when your staff are already working long hours amidst the threat of compulsory redundancy, how much more productive can you get? Probably LESS productive.</p>

<p>But, say senior managers struggling to get by on six figure salaries, there’s no other way to cut costs. We as a university have done everything we can!</p>

<p>This is a true, as a university you have done everything you can do.</p>

<p>But collectively, as a Universities UK, with 141 member institutions, you have done jack shit.</p>

<h2 id="the-ranking-tables-scam">The Ranking Tables Scam</h2>

<p>To get where we’re going, let’s start with the pointless waste of time and money that are University ranking tables, from eg The Guardian, The Times, The Good University Guide. Every year university PR teams pore over the newly published tables to find a statement that is vaguely accurate and sounds good - “proud to announce we’ve vaulted two places in the guide”, “now the highest rated institution … in north west suffolk”. The truth is that if you ignore the dumb ranks, and look at universities’ average scores over a few years they’re all pretty much the same. Wealthy universities do well, upstart institutions with no money do poorly. The rest are middling. Whisper it: there’s not much difference between them.</p>

<p>For all the money spent on marketing, promoting the unique aspects of the campus, the courses, the people, the buildings, the ethos, etc. Most universities in the UK teach mostly the same courses with the same content.</p>

<p>The problem with universities promoting themselves as unique institutions is that they do everything own their own. (because they’re unique!). Except they aren’t. They are all spending huge sums on the same things - Virtual Learning Environments, Digital Exams, Intranet platforms.</p>

<h2 id="the-15-billion-solution">The £1.5 Billion Solution</h2>

<p>In IT alone, 15% savings could be made by working together. Thats up to £250 million a year across the sector.</p>

<p>Universities claim they can’t do this, and must remain independent, citing competition-law concerns and autonomy. Competition Law is a not a problem. The IT service providers will lobby that it is, but this is where your letters to junior ministers come in.</p>

<p>And autonomy? do me a favour. Whose autonomy? “The university”.
The university should have “autonomy” to choose between say Moodle, Blackboard, Canvas and Brightspace for it’s online learning platform? What you mean is that senior management and a special working group wants autonomy. They want to flex their bulging senior management muscles. But for every single person who would actually use the system - the lectures putting crap on it, and the students using it - there is no autonomy at all. They have to use the system they’re provided.</p>

<p>It’s yet another example of the outdated and inefficient management structure of universities costing them millions.</p>

<p>And universities already use collective procurement through UK Universities Purchasing Consortia (UKPC), and other regional bodies. This currently saves about £500 million a year. Nice. but with full nationwide collective procurement, this could be tripled to about £1.5 billion per year. Which would be even nicer.</p>

<h2 id="a-case-study-ethics-systems">A Case Study: Ethics Systems</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a case study. Most universities in the UK use Infonetica Ethics RM for processing ethics applications for research with human participants. Most people who use these systems don’t know that because each university has a separate contract with Infonetica and brands their internal version with their own stupid name for it. It’s a generally slow and clunky system, but that’s common for IT in the education sector. As anyone who has ever applied for ethical approval on this system is only too well aware, it takes hours to figure out what do to and how to complete the online forms in a way that won’t result in multiple length rejections. And as anyone who has ever reviewed ethics applications submitted this way knows only too well, it takes far too long to review each problem and highlight the inconsistencies with uni policy.</p>

<p>This is for many reasons, usually related to the decisions originally made when the uni set up the system with Infonetica many years ago, and the complete lack of useful documentation. Fixing systems with bad UI and bad documentation is slow and expensive. So unis don’t do it. But if the same system is used across more than a 100 universities, each uni’s contribution to fixing the problem is now only 1% of the time and cost. It’s practically free.</p>

<h2 id="shared-teaching-materials">Shared Teaching Materials</h2>

<p>But I would go further than that. Above I noted that most university courses are the same. Does it matter where you study psychology, or mechanical engineering or history? Especially where there is an oversight body (eg the BPS for psychology), there are great similarities, let’s put it that way. so it’s perplexing why individual lecturers spend so many hundreds of hours duplicating the efforts of hundreds of other lecturers replicating similar teaching materials (slides, videos, handouts, worksheets) and assessments (exams, essays, mcqs etc). Modify a shared core, people. Saves time and money.</p>

<p>With all these savings, even in the current crisis in UK HE, there would have been no need for compulsory redundancies. None at all.</p>

<p>It’s too late to save me. But I’d like to think that lessons could be learned. Go out there and make this happen, people!</p>

<h2 id="a-comprehensive-recovery-plan">A Comprehensive Recovery Plan</h2>

<p><strong>In brief:</strong> Years of frozen home-student fees, higher inflation and a recent policy squeeze on international recruitment mean almost half of English universities forecast an operating deficit this year. If Westminster cannot or will not repair the funding model, institutions must take responsibility for their own financial resilience. They can do so without abandoning their charitable mission by (1) diversifying teaching income (micro-credentials, TNE and degree apprenticeships); (2) commercialising research more intelligently; (3) growing philanthropy and endowments; (4) sweating estates and raising low-cost capital through green and social bonds; and (5) driving costs down via sector-wide shared-service platforms. Doing all five together creates a balanced portfolio that reduces exposure to any single government lever.</p>

<h3 id="1-why-the-status-quo-is-unsustainable">1. Why the Status Quo is Unsustainable</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Domestic tuition has been capped at £9,250 since 2017; in real terms it is now worth barely £6,000. The Russell Group calculates that universities already subsidise each UK undergraduate by £2,500 a year, rising to c. £5,000 by 2030 if nothing changes.</li>
  <li>The Office for Students’ latest stress-test shows 43% of providers expect to post a deficit in 2024-25 and sector cash reserves are shrinking.</li>
  <li>Financial pressure is visible to students: 68% now work in term-time and satisfaction with “value for money” has fallen sharply.</li>
  <li>Universities UK warns that new migration rules and frozen fee caps will strip a further £1.4bn from institutional income by 2025-26.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-guiding-principles-for-non-profit-independence">2. Guiding Principles for Non-profit Independence</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Retain charitable status.</strong> Surpluses must continue to be reinvested in teaching, research and civic mission.</li>
  <li><strong>Protect academic freedom and public trust.</strong> Diversification should not compromise integrity or transparency.</li>
  <li><strong>Pursue portfolio balance.</strong> Combine multiple revenue and efficiency moves so no single activity dominates risk.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="3-diversifying-teaching-related-income">3. Diversifying Teaching-related Income</h3>

<p><strong>International Pathways and Transnational Education (TNE)</strong>
UK universities taught 558,000 students offshore in 2021-22 and TNE growth has out-paced on-shore recruitment every year since the pandemic. Scalable franchise or joint-campus models (e.g. Coventry’s global network) spread regulatory risk and generate licence fees with lower capital outlay than a full branch campus.</p>

<p><strong>Micro-credentials and Lifelong Learning</strong>
HEIs already earn about £720m a year from short-course CPD; demand is rising as employers refresh digital skills. These flexible products are insulated from Home-Office visa controls and priced for margin.</p>

<p><strong>Degree Apprenticeships</strong>
With tuition funded through the apprenticeship levy and salaries paid by employers, degree apprenticeships bring net positive cash while widening participation.</p>

<h3 id="4-building-philanthropy-and-endowments">4. Building Philanthropy and Endowments</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Oxford’s <em>Oxford Thinking</em> campaign raised £3.3bn in gifts between 2004-19</li>
  <li>Cambridge’s central endowment has grown to £4.2bn (net asset value, June 2024)</li>
  <li>Structured matching schemes and donor-advised funds can accelerate gift income while keeping control in university hands</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-a-phased-action-plan-for-leaders">5. A Phased Action Plan for Leaders</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>12 months:</strong> map all third-stream income, set clear margin targets for CPD, micro-credentials and contract research</li>
  <li><strong>24 months:</strong> establish or join a shared-services consortium; issue first sustainability-linked private placement if CAPEX pipeline &gt;£100m</li>
  <li><strong>36 months:</strong> launch a global alumni gift-matching challenge and shift at least 5% of investment portfolio into mission-aligned venture funds</li>
  <li><strong>Five-year horizon:</strong> aim for ≥30% of total income to come from non-state, non-regulated tuition sources</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Independence is not a binary switch but a spectrum. By broadening income streams, locking in low-cost mission-aligned capital and sharing back-office functions, UK universities can restore financial headroom and strategic autonomy while remaining firmly not-for-profit. The exemplars already doing this prove it can be done without sacrificing public purpose—or educational quality. What is required now is the collective will to emulate and scale these approaches across the sector.</p>]]></content><author><name>Justin O'Brien</name></author><category term="higher-education" /><category term="university-finance" /><category term="collaboration" /><category term="UK-universities" /><category term="funding-crisis" /><category term="collective-procurement" /><category term="shared-services" /><category term="education-policy" /><category term="institutional-efficiency" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Universities in the UK are in financial trouble.

<p>Calling a university’s strategy its “<strong>business model</strong>” is a bit like calling the Royal Opera House a karaoke bar— both involve singing for money, but that’s where the resemblance ends. Yes, the UK sector’s fiscal plumbing is hissing ominously, but the ‘business model’ mantra pares back a sprawling public-good ecosystem until it resembles someone trying to fund science with a primary-school bake sale.</p>

<h2 id="a-semantic-shambles">A Semantic Shambles</h2>

<p>The word <strong>business</strong> harks back to Old-English <em>bisignes</em>—”being busy with care,” not “squeezing out profit.” When vice-chancellors wax lyrical about their “business model,” we are no longer speaking of scholarship, discovery or civic duty; we are cooing over spreadsheets.</p>

<h3 id="busyness-vs-the-biz">Busyness Vs <em>The Biz</em></h3>

<ul>
  <li>In a functioning university, perhaps 2–3 % of staff genuinely busy themselves with treasury wizardry; the other 97 % teach quantum mechanics, conserve Saxon manuscripts or invent vaccines.</li>
  <li>Letting the financial tail wag the academic dog means treating lecturers as revenue streams and students as balance-sheet “units”—the ultimate triumph of nouns over nuance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-cash-flow-tunnel-vision">The Cash-Flow Tunnel Vision</h2>

<h3 id="what-the-bean-counters-see">What the Bean-Counters See</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Net operating cash-flow in English providers tumbled from <strong>11.6 % to 6.5 %</strong> of income between 2021-22 and 2022-23. Ninety-three institutions are in deficit, 108 expect to join them this year.</li>
  <li>The Russell Group reckons up to <strong>70 %</strong> of universities could plunge into the red by 2025-26 without intervention.</li>
  <li><strong>108 providers</strong> now sit on fewer than 30 days’ cash—financially akin to living on Pot Noodles until payday.</li>
  <li>Domestic tuition fees have risen precisely once since 2012; even a mooted jump to <strong>£9,535</strong> barely dents inflation, leaving a teaching funding shortfall of <strong>£390 million</strong> per annum.</li>
  <li>Students foot the bill: average graduate debt in England hit <strong>£53,000</strong> in 2024-25.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-this-tunnel-vision-misses">What This Tunnel Vision Misses</h3>

<p>Cash-flow models treat higher education as a glorified ATM, ignoring the calculable extras:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Total economic impact (2021-22):</strong> £265 billion—roughly £14 back for every £1 of public money.</li>
  <li><strong>Graduate salary premium:</strong> median £42k versus £30.5k for non-graduates in 2024.</li>
  <li><strong>Extra tax per graduate:</strong> roughly £75k drifts into the Exchequer over a lifetime.</li>
  <li><strong>Lives saved by university research:</strong> 6.3 million worldwide in the first year of the Oxford/AZ vaccine alone.</li>
  <li><strong>Health-span gain:</strong> each extra year of education trims adult-mortality risk by around 2 %.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-wider-ledger-civic-regional-and-planetary-dividends">The Wider Ledger: Civic, Regional and Planetary Dividends</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Universities act as “anchor institutions” spurring local growth; Birmingham’s 2024 study offers tidy ways to count the civic cash.</li>
  <li>Every £1 pumped into universities can add <strong>£14</strong> to private-sector productivity—that’s £40 billion a year in fresh private-sector productivity.</li>
  <li>Northumbria University shows how study meets service: its award-winning Student Law Office has helped overturn wrongful convictions, while its Business Clinic offers free consultancy that keeps hundreds of local SMEs on track —proof that when students roll up their sleeves, academic graft turns directly into social value.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="social-return-on-investment-the-missing-framework">Social Return on Investment: The Missing Framework</h2>

<p>We already possess a toolkit—<strong>Social Return on Investment (SROI)</strong>—to price such intangibles in pounds and pence. If you’ve ever sat through finance committee meeting, you’ll know the room divides neatly into two camps: those who can locate the decimal point on a spreadsheet, and those who nod earnestly while doodling owls in the margins. <strong>Social Return on Investment (SROI)</strong> was invented to help the latter persuade the former that rescuing humanities departments isn’t fiscal vandalism but, in fact, rather good value.</p>

<p>Put plainly, SROI asks: <em>“What would society cough up in hard cash for the lovely side-effects of this project if it had to buy them at B&amp;Q?”</em> You start by identifying every stakeholder likely to benefit—students, local businesses, bored pigeons, whomever—then attach a sensible monetary tag to each outcome, from boosted earnings to fewer GP visits. Finally, you subtract the original outlay and produce a neatly reassuring ratio such as “£1 in, £3 out,” which even the sternest bursar can frame and hang next to the fire exit.</p>

<p>Because it translates woolly concepts like “community cohesion” into shiny pound signs, SROI is catnip to policymakers who worship at the altar of ‘evidence-based’. The snag, of course, is that assigning a sticker price to longer, healthier lives or a cheerier high street requires a smattering of judgement and (brace yourself) talking to real people. This is precisely why the method so often languishes in consultants’ slide decks while Whitehall merrily churns out pie charts based on easier sums—usually ones beginning and ending with tuition-fee income.</p>

<p>In short, it’s the accounting world’s polite reminder that some investments pay back in more than lucre.</p>

<h2 id="why-the-business-model-mindset-is-bad-business">Why the “Business-Model” Mindset Is Bad Business</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Short-termism</strong> – Cap-ex-obsessed MBAs siphon cash from fieldwork to plate-glass atria; The <em>Guardian</em> calls it “whitewashing the tomb” of scholarship.</li>
  <li><strong>Perverse incentives</strong> – Chasing high-fee international students skews curricula and leaves institutions hostage to visa policy.</li>
  <li><strong>Missing markets</strong> – Improved public health, civic stability and democratic engagement don’t show up on purely financial dashboards.</li>
  <li><strong>Erosion of trust</strong> – When barely a fifth of spend reaches academic staff, students understandably ask, “What exactly does my debt fund?”</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="towards-a-university-modelnot-a-business-model">Towards a <em>University Model</em>—Not a <em>Business Model</em></h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Customer → Co-producer of knowledge</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Revenue stream → Social value stream</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Market share → Civic footprint</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Cost centre → Public-investment multiplier</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="practical-fixes">Practical Fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Embed SROI</strong> baselines in OfS returns so every programme reports both cash and social yields.</li>
  <li><strong>Add a Public Value Statement</strong> to the annual report—template courtesy of UUK—quantifying graduate tax boosts, SME support, even carbon savings.</li>
  <li><strong>Ring-fence curiosity-driven research</strong> (yes, the stuff that gave you the Covid jab) so it isn’t raided for short-term liquidity.</li>
  <li><strong>Re-brand finance teams</strong> as enablers, not overlords: their job is to keep the lights on so everyone else can stay <em>busy</em> with the real work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-plea">Final Plea</h2>

<p>If a university’s very purpose is boiled down to its quarterly profit figures, we might as well convert the Bodleian into a bargain-bin bookshop flogging paperbacks two-for-a-pound. Universities, by etymology and by evidence, are about <strong>busyness in the broadest sense</strong>: the restless pursuit of knowledge that pays society back many times over—financially, medically, democratically.</p>

<p>What should the “business model” be? <strong>Busyness itself</strong>: teaching, probing, discovering—always with the public good in mind. Yes, the books must balance (stay tuned for my next piece on how), but the real dividends are educated citizens and new knowledge.</p>]]></content><author><name>Justin O'Brien</name></author><category term="higher-education" /><category term="university-strategy" /><category term="public-value" /><category term="university-business-model" /><category term="SROI" /><category term="social-return-investment" /><category term="public-good" /><category term="UK-universities" /><category term="university-finance" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Calling a university's strategy its 'business model' is like calling the Royal Opera House a karaoke bar.
