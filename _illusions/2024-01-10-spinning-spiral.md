## The Illusion

The spinning spiral creates a powerful motion aftereffect. When you stare at the center of a rotating spiral and then look at a stationary object, that object will appear to move in the opposite direction.

## How It Works

This illusion exploits the motion detection systems in your visual cortex. Neurons that detect motion in one direction become fatigued, causing a temporary imbalance that makes stationary objects appear to move in the opposite direction.

## Step-by-Step Experience

1. **Focus on the Center**: Look directly at the center of the spinning spiral
2. **Maintain Fixation**: Keep your eyes focused on the center point for 30-60 seconds
3. **Look Away Quickly**: Immediately shift your gaze to a nearby wall or object
4. **Observe the Effect**: Notice how the stationary surface appears to move

## Scientific Background

### Neural Mechanisms

The spiral illusion demonstrates several key principles of visual perception:

- **Motion Adaptation**: Prolonged exposure to motion in one direction
- **Directional Selectivity**: Neurons tuned to specific motion directions
- **Opponent Processing**: Balance between opposing motion detectors
- **Aftereffects**: Temporary imbalance in neural responses

### Research History

This illusion has been studied extensively since the 1800s:

- **1834**: Robert Addams first described the "waterfall illusion"
- **1961**: Wohlgemuth studied spiral aftereffects systematically
- **1970s**: Single-cell recordings revealed neural mechanisms
- **Present**: fMRI studies show brain activity patterns

## Safety Notes

⚠️ **Important Warnings:**

- Do not view if you have epilepsy or seizure disorders
- Stop immediately if you feel dizzy or nauseous
- Take breaks every 2-3 minutes during extended viewing
- Children should be supervised when viewing

## Try This at Home

### Materials Needed
- Computer or tablet with this webpage
- Well-lit room
- Nearby wall or neutral surface
- Timer (optional)

### Best Practices
- Sit comfortably at arm's length from screen
- Ensure good lighting to reduce eye strain
- Have a neutral surface nearby to test the aftereffect
- Start with short viewing times (15-30 seconds)
