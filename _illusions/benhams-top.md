## The Illusion

**Benham's Top** (or Benham's Disk) is a pattern of black and white arcs that, when spun at the right speed, produces subjective colors known as **Fechner colors** or **pattern-induced flicker colors (PIFCs)**. 

Different people perceive different colors, ranging from faint reds and yellows to distinct greens and blues, depending on the speed of rotation and the individual's retinal physiology.

## How it Works

The mechanism is not fully understood, but it is believed to be caused by the different rates at which our color-sensitive cone cells (Red, Green, and Blue) respond to flickering light.

1.  **Latency**: Different color receptors in the eye have different latency periods (time to activate) and persistence periods (time to fade).
2.  **Temporal Pattern**: The spinning white arcs stimulate the retina in a specific temporal sequence.
3.  **Neural Confusion**: Because the "Blue" cones might react slower than the "Red" cones, the specific timing of the black-to-white transitions activates them out of sync, tricking the brain into perceiving specific hues even though the stimulus is purely monochromatic.

### Instructions

- **Speed**: Adjust the RPM slider. Different speeds trigger different colors.
- **Direction**: Reversing the spin often reverses the order of the colors (e.g., inside-out vs outside-in).
