## The Hermann grid illusion — a clear, layered explainer

## What you see

A **Hermann grid** is a field of dark squares separated by straight, bright “streets”. Most observers notice **ghostly grey smudges at the intersections** of the bright streets. The smudges vanish if you look straight at an intersection, and they’re most visible a little away from where you’re fixating. The effect works in reverse contrast too (bright smudges on dark “streets”) (Wikipedia, n.d.; Bach, n.d.).

---

## How to make it pop (and how to kill it)

- **High luminance contrast** between squares and streets strengthens the smudges; reducing contrast weakens them (Bach, n.d.).  
- **Straight, uninterrupted, orthogonal bars** are crucial; if you **curve** the bars or **round the corners**, the illusion fades dramatically. This “straightness factor” has been documented experimentally (Geier et al., 2008).  
- The effect is clearest with **moderate street width** (not too thin, not too thick), a **regular lattice** of intersections, and **normal viewing distances** (Bach, n.d.).

---

## A short history

- Often credited to **Ludimar Hermann (1870)**, who noticed the effect while reading a book with matrix-like diagrams. **Ewald Hering** soon noted the reverse-contrast version; **David Brewster** likely reported a related observation even earlier (Wikipedia, n.d.; Illusions Index, n.d.).  
- In the 1990s, **Lingelbach, Schrauf & Wist** introduced the **scintillating grid** variant: grey bars on black with **white discs** at intersections. Observers perceive **black “scintillating” dots** that blink in and out, especially with small eye movements (Schrauf et al., 1997).

---

## The classical account: lateral inhibition (retina)

The **textbook explanation** invokes **centre–surround receptive fields** in the retina (and LGN). A neuron whose receptive-field **centre** sits at a **street intersection** has **more bright surround** than a neuron whose centre lies along a straight street between squares. Surround activation inhibits the centre more at intersections, so the intersection is encoded as slightly **darker** — hence the grey smudges. Two standard corollaries:

1. **Smudges disappear on direct fixation**: in the fovea, receptive fields are very small, so “intersection vs. along-a-street” makes little difference.  
2. **Reverse-contrast version** flips the sign (white smudges on dark streets) via OFF-centre cells.  

This line of thinking goes back to **Baumgartner (1960)** and later reviews (e.g., **Spillmann, 1994**). It’s consistent with classic centre–surround physiology (e.g., Hartline et al., Limulus) and remains widely taught (Spillmann, 1994; Bach, n.d.).

## Where the simple retinal story struggles

Several robust observations don’t sit neatly with a **pure** centre–surround account:

- **Curving or slightly wavering the bars** (or rounding the junctions) **abolishes the smudges**, even though the local luminance configuration at a point is similar — suggesting **orientation/geometry** matters (Geier et al., 2008).  
- There’s a marked **orientation dependence** and the appearance of **phantom bands** when grids are tilted — again pointing to processes beyond circularly symmetric retinal receptive fields (SpringerLink, 2003).  
- The **scintillating grid** behaves differently (requires or is strongly enhanced by **eye movements**; the “dots” blink), and its strength depends on disc and bar geometry in ways that aren’t fully captured by a concentric Mexican-hat filter (Schrauf et al., 1997).

These issues led many researchers to add **cortical, orientation-selective** and **contextual modulation** mechanisms to the explanation. Reviews and re-examinations highlight that **lateral inhibition is part of the story, not the whole** (Schiller, 2005).

## The contemporary view: multiple stages, spatial filters, and context

Today, most vision scientists treat the Hermann family as a **multi-mechanism** phenomenon:

- **Early spatial filtering** (centre–surround, contrast gain control) plausibly creates a **baseline lightness difference** between intersections and corridors (Spillmann, 1994).  
- **Cortical, orientation-selective channels** (e.g., V1-like filters) and **contextual interactions** make the effect **geometry-dependent** (straightness, junction structure), explaining why **curvature** or **irregular spacing** can extinguish it (SpringerLink, 2003).  
- For the **scintillating grid**, **temporal factors** (fixational eye movements, microsaccades) plus the specific **white-disc/grey-bar** arrangement produce the **blink** of dark dots; many demonstrations note that scanning is needed for the full “scintillation” (Schrauf et al., 1997).

A useful practical summary (with demos) is Michael Bach’s compendium: he shows that adding **curvature** also kills the scintillating variant — a compelling nudge that **global layout** matters, not just local centre–surrounds (Bach, n.d.).

---

## Parameter sensitivities (what matters, experimentally)

- **Bar/“street” width**: intermediate widths maximise the effect; very thin or very thick streets reduce it (Bach, n.d.).  
- **Corner geometry**: **rounded corners** or **curvy bars** suppress the illusion (the “straightness factor”) (Geier et al., 2008).  
- **Regularity & density**: many **evenly spaced intersections** strengthen appearance; isolated crossings don’t generally produce scintillation (Wikipedia, n.d.).  
- **Viewing & eye movements**: stronger in **peripheral vision**; direct fixation reduces it. Scintillating dots are particularly tied to **small eye movements** (Schrauf et al., 1997).

---

## Why it still matters

The Hermann grid is more than a party trick. It has been used to **probe receptive-field organisation** and **contextual modulation** in human vision and to test models that combine **retinal** and **cortical** processing (e.g., spatial filtering plus orientation-selective interactions). Continued work — including on **tilt**, **curvature**, and **dynamic variants** — keeps refining how early and mid-level vision interact to construct **lightness** and **contrast** (Spillmann, 1994; SpringerLink, 2003).

---

## The scintillating grid: sibling, not clone

- **Construction**: grey bars on black; **white discs** at intersections.  
- **Percept**: **black dots** appear to pop in and out at the discs (often darker than the background).  
- **Key differences**: stronger **temporal dependence** (eye movements); **geometry of the discs/bars** crucial; doesn’t reduce to the same parameters as the basic Hermann grid (Schrauf et al., 1997; Oxford Academic, n.d.).

## Bottom line

- The Hermann grid’s **grey smudges** arise from **early spatial interactions** (centre–surround / lateral inhibition) **shaped and sometimes overridden** by **orientation-dependent, cortical context effects**.  
- The scintillating grid shares family resemblance but adds **temporal dynamics** and stricter **geometric** constraints.  
- No **single** mechanism elegantly covers **all** variants; the consensus view is **multi-level processing** (retina **and** cortex) with **geometry and eye movements** deciding how strongly you see the effect.
