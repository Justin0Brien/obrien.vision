## Featured Projects

### [Outcomes For Professionals Age 50+ After Redundancy](sankey.html)
An interactive Sankey diagram visualizing employment outcomes for professionals aged 50+ following redundancy, tracking career transitions over 24 months.

## Local Development

This project is configured for rbenv so local runs are seamless and match GitHub Pages’ constraints.

Quick start (macOS):

1) One-time bootstrap

	- Install Homebrew if needed: <https://brew.sh>
	- Run the project setup script:

```bash
./bin/setup
```

1) Start the dev server

```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

Details:

- .ruby-version pins Ruby to 3.2.4 for this repo (rbenv auto-switches).
- Gems install to vendor/bundle (no sudo; no global pollution).
- GitHub Pages compatibility is ensured via the github-pages gem in Gemfile. If you need custom plugins, use a GitHub Actions build instead of Pages’ default.

### Python helper scripts (image pipeline)

Some asset tasks are automated with Python (e.g. `scripts/image_pipeline.py`) to watch `uploads/new` for images and emit optimized WebP + metadata into `assets/images`.

Bootstrap / update the virtual environment:

```bash
./scripts/setup_python_env.sh 3.11
```

Run the image pipeline watcher:

```bash
./scripts/run_image_pipeline.sh
```

Manual activation (alternative):

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/image_pipeline.py
```

Dependencies live in `requirements.txt`.

This repo also includes a `.tool-versions` file. If you use asdf:
