# Test Post: Automated Processing

This is a test post to demonstrate the automated processing pipeline for obrien.vision.

## What This System Does

The automated processing script should:

- Move this file to `_posts/` with proper date-based naming
- Add the correct frontmatter for images and thumbnails
- Process any images in this directory into web and thumbnail versions
- Create the proper directory structure for assets
- Clean up the source files after processing

## Features Being Tested

### File Processing
- Frontmatter preservation and enhancement
- Markdown content preservation
- Date-based filename generation

### Image Handling
- Automatic hero image detection
- Thumbnail generation
- Proper asset organization
- Path reference updates

### Workflow Integration
- Seamless Jekyll integration
- Clean file organization
- Error handling and recovery

## Benefits

This system will significantly streamline the blog posting workflow by:

1. **Eliminating manual file organization**
2. **Automating image processing and optimization**
3. **Ensuring consistent frontmatter structure**
4. **Creating proper thumbnail versions automatically**
5. **Maintaining clean asset organization**

The goal is to make publishing new content as simple as dropping files in a folder and running a single command!

## Next Steps

Once this test works correctly, we can enhance the system with:
- ImageMagick integration for image optimization
- Automatic watermarking
- EXIF metadata management
- Advanced resizing and compression

Let's see how it works!
