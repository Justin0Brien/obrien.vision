AI is in a terrible hype cycle. The bubble is inflating fast with no revenue in sight. So why am I still so excited? 🤔 🤷 I shouldn’t be. A rational person would view from afar while the circus burns through its venture capital. Why the scepticism is deserved ⚠️ - AI is built on invisible labour for pennies - ethics hidden in the footnotes no one reads. - Silicon Valley swagger meets “fair use” theology: disrupt first, indemnify later. - Hallucinations dressed up as facts, biases served as insights - an all-you-can-eat buffet of internet leftovers. - GPU farms guzzling megawatts so to rewrite an email I don't even send. - Bubble theatre: immaculate demos and breathless hype, but profit and AGI remain “just around the corner.” And yet, here’s why I’m excited anyway ✨ - They translate, summarise, brainstorm and code at speeds unimaginable a few years ago - They turn scribbles and half-baked notions into credible drafts in just a handful of prompts. - For teaching, accessibility, and research they achieve the previously impossible. - They give individuals the power once reserved for institutions with marble foyers. So yes: both an ethical conundrum and a marvel. My rule of thumb is simple - focus on real gains rather than vibes, ensure the data supply chain is paid fairly, cut the carbon cost per token, avoid the theatre of “safety” filters, teach critical use, and keep humans firmly in control. 👉 Be honest - are LLMs saving you hours, or just sneaking off with your attention while pretending to help? Where’s your red line? #AI #LLM #Ethics #ResponsibleAI #HigherEducation #EdTech #Productivity #Copyright #DataGovernance #Sustainability
