🔴 It’s Red University Day. 🔴 I have already posted the “I’m only mildly alarmed” (🟢) and “I’m checking the exits, but calmly” (🟠) lists. Today is the institutions that will probably have to do something properly dramatic over the next five years (or have already started). Not “change the logo and launch a new strategy”. More the sort of thing that turns up in the minutes as ‘transformational options’. What “something dramatic” looks like will vary. I do not think most are existentially doomed, but the menu is not especially comforting: mergers, sub-merger cost sharing, “strategic partnerships” that smell faintly of takeover, refinancing that comes with a helpful banker permanently installed in the passenger seat, or the kind of cost cutting 🧑🏽‍🎓🔫 that makes HR develop a nervous tick. Some will try to carve out a defensible niche and survive on specialism, efficiency, or sheer bloody-mindedness. These traffic-light lists are not (entirely) a figment of my imagination. They are based on my analysis of thousands of annual reports plus third-party data. I will publish the methodology and analysis next week, because everyone loves statistics. (Everyone.)
