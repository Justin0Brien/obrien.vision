They’re the Jenga piece you daren’t touch, the quiet support holding up a rickety tower. They’re the espresso shot in a gallon of lukewarm latte. 🤑 International Students 🤑 I’ve written a short piece that cuts through the noise and looks at what the numbers actually say: nearly half of universities facing deficits; a £37bn net boost to the UK from one cohort; the Graduate route not being abused; and why clumsy visa tweaks could torch a major export overnight. It also sets out a smarter fix: tighten compliance, build more student housing, protect research, and keep routes that work. 👇Read the article: 👇 #HigherEducation #InternationalStudents #UKHE #PublicPolicy #ResearchFunding #GraduateRoute #Migration #DataNotDrama
