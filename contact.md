# Get in Touch

If you’re exploring a project in **AI**, **psychology**, or **vision science**—or you’ve simply got a question about my work—I’d be glad to hear from you.

## Professional inquiries

**Email**: [justin@obrien.vision](mailto:justin@obrien.vision)

## Social & professional networks

**LinkedIn**: [linkedin.com/in/justin08rien](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin08rien)

## What I work on

- **AI & LLMs**: evaluation, safety and alignment; on‑device models (Apple Silicon/MPS); chatbots with structured memory; moderation and jailbreak detection.
- **Reproducible research**: pre‑registration, transparent analysis pipelines, and audit trails (including zero‑knowledge proof approaches linking raw data to results).
- **Vision & perception**: visual cognition, illusions, and experiment design.
- **Data visualisation**: clear, publication‑ready figures and interactive web demos for teaching and research.
- **Teaching & curriculum design**: research methods and statistics for psychology.

If you’re unsure whether your idea fits, feel free to write anyway.

## Ways we can work together

- **Research collaborations** (AI, psychology, and vision research)
- **Consulting & advisory** (methods, analysis, LLM deployment, evaluation)
- **Talks, workshops, and teaching** (research methods, statistics, AI literacy)

## For students and early‑career researchers

I’m happy to offer brief pointers or signposting when I can. If you’re seeking detailed feedback on manuscripts or code, please include a short summary and a specific question in your message.

## Response time

I typically reply within **2–3 business days**. For urgent matters, please note this in your subject line. I’m based in **London, UK**.
